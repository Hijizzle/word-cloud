# word-cloud
Simple word cloud creator that displays results in an HTML created display

This was originally created as an assignment to word cloud a transcript of the presidential debates but has since been modified
to turn text files into a word cloud. It is very barren in its current state but I intend to clean it up and make it more robust
as I dive deepere into this project.

# How to run
1. Open wordCloudGen.py in a python editor (or terminal) and run the script.
2. Type in the file name to be anaylzed (EXAMPLE_FILE.txt is provided as an example)
3. Open the output HTML file generated after the program finishes executing.

That's about it in its current state.
